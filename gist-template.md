# Title (replace with your title)

Welcome to my Gist! In this gist I will breakdown a regular expression (regex) and show you how it works piece by piece. This particular regex will be 
used for matching an email address in a string of text.

## Summary


The following snippet of code is a regex used to match an email address. I will explain what each character does sequentially and how they all fit together to do something cool.
`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

## Regex Components
the language of a regex is broken up into several sub categories outlined below.

### Anchors
anchors are used to orient oneself within a regex. For example, the ^ matches a string that includes all of the characters that follow it, and the $ matches all of the characters that precede it. In this case, the ^ and $ encompass the whole regex, showing that we are only looking for one thing that matches the paramaters set between those two characters.
